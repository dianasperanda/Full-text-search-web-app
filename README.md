# Full-text-search-web-app
Made ASP.NET MVC app for adding movies in database. This project was homework for subject about databases and the key point was to implement Full Text Search and Pivoting search results.

Using PostgreSQL and virtual server where I kept database, the task was to connect to that database and implement:

1) Add new data
2) Search data using Full text search (Based on morphology&semantic)
3) Support for connecting search query with logical operators & and |
4) Generate and show SQL query which returns requested data
5) Analize all search querys and show granulation for time period by days or hours
